# ShadowFox Internship Experience üöÄ
  I had the incredible opportunity to work as a Java Developer Intern 
  at ShadowFox, where I was immersed in a dynamic learning 
  environment. Over the course of one month, I gained hands-on 
  experience in various small but impactful projects that sharpened 
  my technical skills and broadened my understanding of real-world 
  software development.

üõ† Technologies Mastered:
   During my time at ShadowFox, I worked extensively with the 
   following technologies:

*  Core Java: Leveraged fundamental Java concepts like object- 
   oriented programming (OOP), collections, streams, and exception 
   handling to develop clean and efficient code.
   
*  Spring Boot: Built and optimized RESTful services and 
   microservices using Spring Boot, focusing on creating scalable, 
   modular, and maintainable backend solutions.
   
*  SQLite: Utilized SQLite for lightweight database management, 
   ensuring smooth data storage and retrieval for the applications I 
   developed.
   
*  JUnit: Wrote and implemented unit tests using JUnit, ensuring that 
   the code was well-tested and met the quality standards required 
   for deployment.

üåü Projects Contributed To:

1. Task Manager App:
   In this project, I developed a task management feature that 
   allowed users to create, update, and delete tasks. I worked 
   primarily on integrating the backend with a user-friendly frontend 
   and implemented database management using SQLite to store user 
   tasks efficiently. Using Spring Boot, I ensured that the 
   application was highly modular, and with JUnit, I rigorously 
   tested all the backend functionalities to guarantee smooth 
   operation.

2. Inventory Management System:
   I contributed to a small-scale Inventory Management System for 
   managing stock levels and product information. My primary 
   responsibility was to develop backend services that would interact 
   with the SQLite database to manage product details, stock counts, 
   and sales history. I learned how to optimize database queries and 
   enhance application performance, ensuring a seamless user 
   experience.

3. Employee Management API:
   I worked on building a REST API for an employee management system 
   that allowed for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on 
   employee records. This was a key project where I further honed my 
   understanding of Spring Boot, developing endpoints that handled 
   requests and responses securely and efficiently. I also 
   implemented validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity.

üë®‚Äçüè´ Collaboration & Mentorship:
    Throughout the internship, I regularly sought guidance from my 
    ShadowFox mentor, who provided invaluable feedback and support. I 
    also collaborated with my college friends to brainstorm solutions 
    and debug challenging issues. This internship not only improved 
    my technical abilities but also enhanced my communication and 
    teamwork skills.

üöÄ Open for Collaboration!
    Feel free to explore the projects I‚Äôve worked on! If you spot any 
    areas for improvement or have suggestions, you‚Äôre more than 
    welcome to fork this repository and submit your contributions. 
    I'm open to feedback and always eager to learn and collaborate 
    with fellow developers. Let‚Äôs connect and grow together!
