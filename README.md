# ShadowFox
I had the opportunity to work as a Java Developer intern at ShadowFox, where I contributed to several small-scale projects. These projects involved technologies such as SQLite, JUnit, core Java, and Spring Boot. During my internship, I overcame challenges with the support of my mentor at ShadowFox, who was always ready to guide me. I also collaborated with my college peers for additional insights and assistance.

Feel free to check out my projects, and if you spot any areas for improvement, you are welcome to fork the repository and submit your corrections. I'm always open to constructive feedback and eager to learn through collaboration.
